# Red Badger Test

This project requires the TypeScript compiler to be installed in order to be built. I have been using `yarn`, but it should be possible to substitute `yarn` for `npm` in the instructions below. You can build it with

```
yarn build
```

And run the test suite with

```
yarn test
```

In order to provide an output the program needs an input file, there is one at `build/input.txt`. You can run the program on this file with

```
node build/index.js --input=input.txt
```
